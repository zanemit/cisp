This is a personal playground that preceded development of the official [_Climatematch Impact Scholars Program_ jupyterbook](https://programs.climatematch.io/impact-scholars/intro.html). 

Nowadays, this primarily serves as an easy way to help teammates with less git/jb experience visualise, and provide feedback on, major updates in the programme's jupyterbook prior to their deployment.

Built by following the [jupyterbook docs](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).
